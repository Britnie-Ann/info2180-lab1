        <h2>Britnie-Ann Gray</h2>
        <p>Hello, I am a second year Computing student at the University of the West Indies.
            I started my coding journey in the summer of grade 11. I signed up for a coding camp
            and enjoyed it so much so that I decided to pursue a career in technology. I am still
            unsure as to the specific branch in technology I would like to specialize in however
            I am just enjoying my time until I have to make that decision. In my free time I like 
            to play games, specifically one named Genshin, as well as watch movies, cook and read
            fictional books. I am currently taking a course called Info 2180 and so far I am enjoying it.</p>
